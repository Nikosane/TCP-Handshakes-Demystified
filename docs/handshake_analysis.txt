TCP 3-Way Handshake Analysis
============================

This file contains a detailed explanation of the TCP 3-way handshake captured in the tcp_handshake.pcap file.

1. SYN (synchronize): The initiating client sends a SYN packet to start the connection.
2. SYN+ACK (synchronize-acknowledge): The server responds with a SYN+ACK packet to acknowledge the request.
3. ACK (acknowledge): The client sends an ACK packet to confirm the connection.

The handshake establishes a reliable connection between the client and the server, allowing them to exchange data.
